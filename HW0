Project Proposal (Subject to change in the future for resubmission)
Team: Gordon Ngo, Sean Wolford

Multi-source audio-only music playlist creator and streaming. Name is TBA. The application will allow music videos to stream as 
audio only to reduce loading time, especially for mobile users. The application's speciality will be the capability to build 
playlists from various sources (Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.),  users will be able to befriend one another, share and 
develop playlists. Users can visualize what artists, channels, etc. they or their friends visit most on a graph or plot using
pre-existing visualization in D3. This feature will be important as it will help show what tracks or playlists are trending.
A simple upvoting or karma system should be a feature to gauge the popularity of a playlist or playlist creator. 

It would be expected for our team to be using the Youtube and Soundcloud API for this, however we may run into legal issues trying
do something that is crossplatform as well as the audio-only feature. Feature modifications may be necessary, however 
the overall theme of social playlist sharing, etc. will likely stay. An example idea in line with out playlist creation 
theme would be making a localized music sharing/trending application.
