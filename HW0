Project Proposal (Subject to change in the future for resubmission)

Multi-source audio-only music playlist creator and streaming. Name is TBA. The application will allow music videos to stream as 
audio only to reduce loading time, especially for mobile users. The application's speciality will be the capability to build 
playlists from various sources (Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.),  users will be able to befriend one another, share and 
develop playlists. Users can visualize what artists, channels, etc. they or their friends visit most on a graph or plot using D3.
It would be expected for our team to be using the Youtube and Soundcloud API for this, however we may run into legal issues trying
do something that is crossplatform as well as the audio-only feature.
